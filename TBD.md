Great choice! A **custom VPN (or SSH-based proxy)** is a **powerful networking project** ‚Äî real-world useful, technically deep, and perfectly doable in **Go or Python**.

Let me break it down for you step-by-step.

## üß† What Is a Custom VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network):

* Creates a **secure tunnel** between a client and server
* Encrypts data (typically via TLS/SSL or SSH)
* Forwards network traffic through the tunnel
* Helps bypass restrictions or protect data on public networks

Your custom VPN will **act as a proxy**, forwarding data from the client to the target server via your VPN server.

## üéØ MVP Goals (Phase 1: SOCKS5 or TCP Tunneling Proxy)

1. ‚úÖ **Client**

   * Connects to your VPN server
   * Sends data to be forwarded (e.g., HTTP requests, SSH, etc.)

2. ‚úÖ **Server**

   * Listens for incoming client connections
   * Forwards traffic to the intended destination (like a reverse proxy)
   * Optionally logs, filters, or modifies traffic

3. ‚úÖ **Secure the tunnel**

   * Use SSH or TLS
   * Encrypt the traffic between client and server

4. ‚úÖ **Optional Features**

   * Authentication
   * IP blocking, whitelisting
   * Web dashboard (Flask/FastAPI or Go frontend)

## üîß Tech Stack Suggestions

| Language   | Why it works well                                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Go**     | Native support for concurrency, networking (goroutines, net package), fast and compiled |
| **Python** | Easier to start with, use `asyncio`, `socket`, `ssl`, `paramiko` for SSH                |

## üß≠ Project Roadmap (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: Learn the Basics**

* Understand TCP sockets: `socket` in Python or `net` in Go
* Play with a TCP echo server/client

> *Goal*: Get comfortable sending and receiving data over sockets.

---

### **Step 2: Build a Basic Proxy**

* A simple server that accepts client connections
* Reads data and forwards it to a destination (e.g., google.com:443)
* Sends back the response

> *Goal*: You‚Äôve made a basic TCP forwarder.

---

### **Step 3: Add TLS/SSH Encryption**

* For TLS: Use `ssl.wrap_socket()` in Python or `crypto/tls` in Go
* For SSH: Use `paramiko` in Python or `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` in Go

> *Goal*: Traffic between client ‚Üî server is encrypted

---

### **Step 4: Add SOCKS5 Support (Optional, but powerful)**

* Implement or use a library to parse SOCKS5 headers
* Let clients (like Chrome or curl) use your VPN as a SOCKS proxy

> *Result*: You now support apps using your VPN natively!

---

### **Step 5: Logging, Auth, and Extras**

* Add logging to see which IPs accessed what
* Add token-based or password auth
* Add bandwidth limits or filters

---

## üõ† Example Tools & Libraries

### In **Python**:

* `socket`, `ssl`, `select` (for basic network IO)
* `asyncio` (for async proxy)
* `paramiko` (for SSH tunneling)
* `pysocks` (SOCKS5 client/server)

### In **Go**:

* `net`, `tls`, `bufio`
* `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`
* Existing example: [sshuttle (Python)](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle) ‚Äî VPN over SSH

---

## üîê Bonus Idea: ‚ÄúVPN over SSH‚Äù

* Use SSH to establish a tunnel (`ssh -L` style)
* Your server accepts SSH and forwards ports (e.g., port 80 on localhost to a remote)

---

## üì¶ Deliverables for Resume/Portfolio

* `client/` and `server/` directories
* README with usage instructions
* Demo GIF or YouTube link showing it proxying requests
* Optional: web dashboard with logs (Flask or React + Go backend)

---

## Want a Template to Get Started?

I can scaffold a basic TCP proxy for you in:

* Python with `socket`
* or Go with `net.Listen`

Let me know your preferred language, and I‚Äôll give you a starter repo layout and code to begin building your VPN!
